# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning
The course covers supervised classification based on e.g., 
artificial neural networks (deep learning), as well as unsupervised learning (clustering), regression, optimization (evolutionary algorithms and 
other search methods) and reinforcement learning, in addition to design of experiments and evaluation.
